# Week 1 of Practicing

## Topics
    ✔ Arrays, strings
    ✔ Basic recursion
    ✔ Hashing / maps / sets
    ✔ Sorting techniques & custom comparators
    ✔ Prefix sums, sliding window, two pointers
    ✔ Binary search (regular + on answer)

## Target Problem Types
    ✔ Two-pointer patterns
    ✔ Prefix/suffix techniques
    ✔ HashMap tricks
    ✔ Binary search on answer (classic: minimum days, allocate pages)
